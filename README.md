# EXPA-mazon (Exoplanet Archive Marketplace)

# Node.js & MySQL

## Overview

The task was to create 
* an Amazon-like storefront
* take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory
* provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store

I didn't follow the instructions to the letter. I created my mock store to sell discovered exoplanets -- for the right price. The database is a subset of the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=compositepars).

## Submission Guide

Make sure you use the normal GitHub. Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include screenshots, a gif, and/or a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots or a link to a video in a `README.md` file.

* Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the customer and if relevant the manager/supervisor). This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection (for the different selection options).

* Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers/other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works. 

* Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading.

If you haven't written a markdown file yet, [click here for a rundown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), or just take a look at the raw file of these instructions.
