# EXPA-mazon (Exoplanet Archive Marketplace)

## Node.js & MySQL

## Overview

The task was to create 
* an Amazon-like storefront
* take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory
* provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store

I didn't follow the instructions to the letter. I created my mock store to sell discovered exoplanets -- for the right price. The database is a subset of the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=compositepars).
